The moonies are up on a mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture

Singing, "We're here to keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To The Daily Mail
Together
Together"

You made a pig's ear, you made a mistake
Paid off security and got through the gate
You got away with it but we lie in wait

Where's the truth? What's the use?
I'm hanging around lost and found
And when you're here innocent
Fat chance, no plan

No regard for human life
Keep time, you've no right
You're fast to lose, you will lose
Drop the queue, go back again

President for life, love of all
The flies in the sky
The beasts of the earth, the fish in the sea
You've lost command
