Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can

When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to
Did I see you messing me around?
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts

Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That you can’t create, that you can’t create, that you can’t
Pieces of a wreck of mankind
That you can’t create, that you can’t create, that you can’t

When all I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to
When I see you searching me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know
